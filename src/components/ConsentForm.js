            <h3>Purpose and Goals of This Research</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                The purpose of this study is to investigate how Free Prompting and Assisted Prompting affect response quality and task completion time in open-ended language model (LLM) tasks. The goal of this study is to examine the impact of Free and Assisted Prompting on the quality and accuracy of responses in open-ended tasks using language models (LLMs). Your participation will help us achieve this research goal. The results of this research may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific proceedings and journals.
            </p>

            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Your participation in this online study is entirely voluntary and can be discontinued or withdrawn at any time. You can refuse to answer any questions or continue with the study at any time if you feel uncomfortable in any way. You can discontinue or withdraw your participation at any time without giving a reason. However, we reserve the right to exclude you from the study (e.g., with invalid trials or if continuing the study could have a negative impact on your well-being or the equipment).You will also receive the compensation offered if you discontinue study participation. Repeated participation in the study is not permitted.
            </p>
            <h3>Study Procedure</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                After confirming this informed consent the procedure is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Demographics:</b> Participants first fill out a questionnaire on demographic data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Instruction:</b> A brief description along with instructions of the tasks will be provided.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Task:</b> Participants will complete 5 scenarios using both Free and Assisted prompting, presented in a shuffled order based on a Balanced Latin Square design; for Assisted prompting, five AI-generated questions will be provided to guide participants toward improved responses, followed by a short questionnaire after each scenario.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Post-test evaluation:</b> After completing the tasks, participants fill out a short questionnaire.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The confirmation of participation in this study can be obtained directly from the researchers.

            <h3>Risks and Benefits</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                In the online study you will not be exposed to any immediate risk or danger. As with all computer systems on which data is processed, despite security measures, there is a small risk of data leakage and the loss of confidential or personal information. As compensation for your participation, you will receive one credit point for the lecture. With your participation you support our research work and contribute to a better understanding of human-computer interaction.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Protection and Confidentiality</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                In this study, personal and personal data are collected for our research.

This means that you can view, correct, restrict processing, and delete the data collected in this study. Only with your agreement, we will log your input and manually record notes in the study. We plan to publish the results of this and other research studies in academic articles or other media. Your data will not be retained for longer than necessary or until you contact researchers to have your data destroyed or deleted. Access to the raw data, transcribed interviews, and observation protocols of the study during the analysis is encrypted, password-protected and only accessible to the authors, colleagues, and researchers collaborating on this research. As part of the research, the data will be fully anonymized and then be made available to the general public, whereas no conclusions can be drawn about individual persons anymore. Once the material has been made publicly available, the distribution of the data can no longer be revoked. Any interview content or direct quotations from the interview, that are made available through academic publications or other academic outlets will also be fully anonymized. Contact details (e.g. e-mails) will not be passed on to third parties, but may be used by the researchers to contact participants, trace infection chains, or to send you further details of the study. According to the GDPR, the researchers will inform the participants using their contact details if a confidential data breach has been detected.
